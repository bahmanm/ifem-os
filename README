IFEM-OS (Industrial Fault-tolerant EMbedded Operating System)


== Introduction ==

IFEM is a prototype for my BS thesis; it presented a new approach for designing
operating system by reducing the kernel size and responsibilities to almost a
simple initialisation routine and let the modules do the rest.  The idea is 
heavily inspired by ExoKernel and MicroKernel paradigms.


== Features ==

When IFEM boots, it does two jobs:  counting the clock ticks and showing the key
code for every key you press.  So you can use it as a chronometer and a keyboard
test software ;-)


== Notes ==

* Despite my love for operating system development, IFEM development has been
  stalled since late 2005 since I had other priorities.  If you're interested in
  developing IFEM I'll gladly help you in your way.
